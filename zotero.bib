	abstract = {We study localization at a prime in homotopy type theory, using self maps of the circle. Our main result is that for a pointed, simply connected type \$X\$, the natural map \$X {\textbackslash}to X\_\{(p)\}\$ induces algebraic localizations on all homotopy groups. In order to prove this, we further develop the theory of reflective subuniverses. In particular, we show that for any reflective subuniverse \$L\$, the subuniverse of \$L\$-separated types is again a reflective subuniverse, which we call \$L'\$. Furthermore, we prove results establishing that \$L'\$ is almost left exact. We next focus on localization with respect to a map, giving results on preservation of coproducts and connectivity. We also study how such localizations interact with other reflective subuniverses and orthogonal factorization systems. As key steps towards proving the main theorem, we show that localization at a prime commutes with taking loop spaces for a pointed, simply connected type, and explicitly describe the localization of an Eilenberg-Mac Lane space \$K(G,n)\$ with \$G\$ abelian. We also include a partial converse to the main theorem.},

We focus on five core issues: (1) task selection, coverage, and evaluation, (2) the process of doing a Cognitive Walkthrough, (3) requisite knowlege for the evaluators, (4) group walkthroughs, and (5) the interpretation of results. Our findings show that many variables can affect the success of the technique; we believe that if the Cognitive Walkthrough is ultimately to be successful in industrial settings, the method must be refined and augmented in a variety of ways.},

	title = {Extending {Homotopy} {Type} {Theory} with {Strict} {Equality}},
	doi = {10.4230/lipics.csl.2016.21},
	abstract = {In homotopy type theory (HoTT), all constructions are necessarily stable under homotopy equivalence. This has shortcomings: for example, it is believed that it is impossible to define a type of semi-simplicial types.  More generally, it is difficult and often impossible to handle towers of coherences. To address this, we propose a 2-level theory which features both strict and weak equality. This can essentially be represented as two type theories: an "outer" one, containing a strict equality type former, and an "inner" one, which is some version of HoTT. Our type theory is inspired by Voevodsky's suggestion of a homotopy type system (HTS) which currently refers to a range of ideas. A core insight of our proposal is that we do not need any form of equality reflection in order to achieve what HTS was suggested for. Instead, having unique identity proofs in the outer type theory is sufficient, and it also has the meta-theoretical advantage of not breaking decidability of type checking. The inner theory can be an easily justifiable extensions of HoTT, allowing the construction of "infinite structures" which are considered impossible in plain HoTT. Alternatively, we can set the inner theory to be exactly the current standard formulation of HoTT, in which case our system can be thought of as a type-theoretic framework for working with "schematic" definitions in HoTT. As demonstrations, we define semi-simplicial types and formalise constructions of Reedy fibrant diagrams.},

In this setting we show how to construct a universe that classifies the Cohen-Coquand-Huber-Mörtberg (CCHM) notion of fibration from their cubical sets model, starting from the assumption that the interval is tiny - a property that the interval in cubical sets does indeed have. This leads to an elementary axiomatization of that and related models of homotopy type theory within what we call crisp type theory.},
